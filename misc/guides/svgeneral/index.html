<h3><span class="fw-bold">What is shiny-locked and what isn't?</span></h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Static encounters, such as Gimmighoul, Koraidon, and Miraidon. 
    <li>All in-game trades are shiny-locked.

<h3><span class="fw-bold">What is Terastalizing?</span></h3>
 
<p>The term ‘shiny-locked’ refers to the ability of a Pokémon to be shiny or not; some Pokémon, such as those listed below, cannot be shiny even if reset.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Terastalizing your Pokémon will add the Tera Type of your Pokémon, causing the following:
      <ul>
        <li>All moves of this type will receive a 1.5x STAB bonus.
            <ul>
              <li>If the move already receives a 1.5x STAB bonus, such as a Fire-type Pokémon Terastilizing as a Fire-type and using a Fire-type move, the bonus becomes 2.0x.</li>
            </ul>
      </ul>
    <li>All in-game trades are shiny-locked.
      <ul>
        <li>All other typings of the Pokémon are removed, and the Pokémon becomes the specific Tera Type it transforms into.
      </ul>
    <li>All in-game gifts are shiny-locked.
    <li>The starter Pokémon are shiny-locked.
  </ul>
<br />
